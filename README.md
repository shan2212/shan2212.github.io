## Welcome to My GitHub Page

This space is primarily for Tech Talks. 


## Agenda

There are tons of pages available in the internet which talks about technologies and concepts. 
However, very few of them talks about real production issues. 

This page is dedicated to answer you questions and provide you the ultimate knowledge on the subject. 

My main objective is to deliver high quality content to all my readers.
